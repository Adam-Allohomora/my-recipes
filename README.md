This project presents a recipe website created using the HTML basics
learned with the Odin project.This will give us the opportunity to use
tags to create links, images, lists, navigate between pages and create an interface giving access to three recipes.Each recipe has a description, a list of ingredients to use to make
it and a list of steps to follow to complete the recipe.
We'll also have the opportunity to familiarize ourself with git, in particular with the 
various basics commands for adding our project to github.
